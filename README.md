# The Gopher Project

## Why Us

I learnt how to program using The Odin Project, and I am a huge fan of the project based learning approach. I believe it's the only way you actually learn something and I felt it missing for the Go ecosystem. It's a brilliant language, however it's difficult for beginners to get into because of the lack of quality tutorial.

Hence, The Gopher Project. 

We intend to provide the best Go project based learning platform for absolutely free because programming should be free for everybody.
