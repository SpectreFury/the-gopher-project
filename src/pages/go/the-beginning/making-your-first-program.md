## Hello World

We are going to start off very simple and write what's called a "Hello World" program. It's like a initiation ceremony and after you write this, you can be called a Go programmer.

### Creating our first package

We will create our first go package in this tutorial. A Go package is a collection of one or more go files that are supposed to do a single thing. Let's assume we want to make a calculator project where each go file will be an operation i.e adding, subtraction. It makes sense to make a calculator project and let all the operations be individual go files which may or may not interact with each other.

It's easier to understand once you do this yourself, so let's make a simple go project. Assuming you have properly done the last lesson and have a successfully installed go compiler, we can use the Go CLI to make a project.

The first thing we're going to do is make a directory where you're gonna do all the tutorials or anything related to The Gopher Project. It can be anywhere of your computer.

Open your terminal and navigate to wherever you want the directory to be and then type the following.

```
mkdir thegopherproject
```

This will create the directory "thegopherproject" at your preferred location.

Now let's get inside this directory. For that, type:

```
cd thegopherproject
```

Once you do that, your terminal will probably say something like

```
thegopherproject -> ~
```

Now we can finally start with our first Go module.

### Go Modules

## Assignment

This is time for your first assignment. Some of these are going to just be things that you have to read (boring, I know,) and the others, you'll have to do yourself. I suggest you do both, as it will be a great opportunity to learn from official resources as well as the ones we provide.

1. Check out the Go [Wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)>). You don't have to read absolutely everything, just get an idea about the language.
