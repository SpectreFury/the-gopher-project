### A Bit of History

Go, also called Golang, was created at Google in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It was created to provide a statically and strongly typed language similar to C in syntax, but also with features such as memory safety, garbage collection.

## Why Choose Go?

There are hundreds if not thousands of programming languages, so why choose Go?

### Simplicity

Go was designed with simplicity in mind. The language has a small set of keywords and a clean syntax that makes it easy to read and understand. This simplicity doesn't come at the cost of power â€“ Go provides all the tools you need to build robust applications.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, Go!")
}
```

### Performance

Go compiles to native machine code, which means that your program is going to be converted into a binary and not into any intermediate (looking at you Java.) This results in extremely fast applications that are efficient in their memory usage. The garbage collector is designed for low latency, making Go suitable for high-performance applications.

Other than that, you will come to learn very quickly that Go applications compiles really fast, and if you have worked with a CMake or a Java project, you will know the difference.

### Batteries Included

Go has almost everything you need to build a fully fledged application from the get go. It's library is vast providing packages to create anything from a simple CLI application to a production ready web server.

## Growing Ecosystem

With strong backing from Google and widespread adoption by companies like Docker, Kubernetes, and many others, Go has a thriving ecosystem of tools and libraries.
